## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to reinforcement learning (RL), a subfield of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents ought to take actions in an environment to maximize the notion of cumulative reward. Topics covered include:

- Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
- Value functions and Bellman equations
- Dynamic programming methods
- Monte Carlo methods
- Temporal difference learning
- Function approximation
- Policy gradient methods
- Deep reinforcement learning
- Applications of RL in robotics and other domains

---

## Prerequisites

- Strong background in probability and statistics
- Familiarity with linear algebra and calculus
- Programming experience (Python recommended)
- Basic knowledge of machine learning concepts

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Understand the fundamental concepts and mathematical foundations of reinforcement learning
2. Implement and apply various RL algorithms including value-based, policy-based, and actor-critic methods
3. Analyze and compare different RL approaches for various problem domains
4. Apply RL techniques to solve real-world problems
5. Understand current research trends and challenges in reinforcement learning
